## ðŸ“Œ Objectives
- Analyze the correlation between audio attributes (BPM, energy, danceability, etc.) and song popularity.  
- Cluster songs into different groups using **K-Means** based on audio features.  
- Compare popularity across different clusters.  
- Explore artist collaboration and its impact on popularity.

## ðŸ”Ž Methodology & Code Examples

### 1. Load and Inspect Data
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("spotify_songs.csv", encoding="latin1")

# Check structure
print(df.head())
print(df.info())
```

### 2. Data Cleaning
